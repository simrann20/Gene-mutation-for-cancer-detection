## Gene Mutation Classification Through Text Evidences

This project seeks to carry out the classification of the gene mutations through the textual evidence, which would further help in the detection of cancer tumours in an efficient and faster manner as compared to the manual approach followed by pathologists. The text evidence here has been processed by using NLP techniques.
